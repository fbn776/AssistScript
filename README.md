AssistScript is a simple scripting(?) language that I made for fun.
Not very useful, but it's fun to play around with.
Initially started as a joke, but I decided to make it a bit more serious.

The language is very simple, all you have to do is specify a command and its arguments.
And has a basic syntax as
```asrc
<command> <arg1> <arg2> ... <argN>
```
eg:
```asrc
add 10 20 40
```
Outputs 70
